Manage and program ESP8266/ESP32 microcontrollers through YAML configuration files

## About

This add-on allows you to manage and program your ESP8266 and ESP32 based microcontrollers
directly through Hass.io **with no programming experience required**. All you need to do
is write YAML configuration files; the rest (over-the-air updates, compiling) is all
handled by esphomeyaml.
